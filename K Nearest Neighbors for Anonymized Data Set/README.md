# K Nearest Neighbors For Anonymized Data Set

## Overview
This notebook applies the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to an anonymized dataset as part of a data science interview simulation. The goal is to predict a target variable using KNN, illustrating how to handle datasets where feature names and their specific significance may be obscured.

The notebook is structured to guide a user through the process of using the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm on an anonymized dataset, from initial data loading and exploration through to model training and evaluation. It showcases typical data science processes such as exploratory data analysis, model tuning, and result interpretation, making it a valuable practical example for learners and practitioners alike. This detailed step-by-step approach helps in understanding not just the application of KNN but also in handling datasets where the direct meaning of features is not known, a common scenario in real-world data science tasks. ​


## Introduction:

- Purpose: Describes the aim of using the KNN algorithm for an anonymized dataset, mimicking a real-world data science interview scenario.
- Context: Mention of the course this project is associated with.

## Importing Libraries and Dataset:

- Libraries Imported:

    - pandas for data manipulation.
    - seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot for visualization.
    - numpy for numerical operations.

- Data Loading:
The dataset, presumably containing features for use in the KNN model, is loaded into a DataFrame df from a CSV file named KNN_Project_Data.
## Initial Data Exploration:

- Displaying Data: 
The first few rows of the dataset are displayed using df.head(), allowing for a preliminary look at the structure and type of data included.

## Further Analysis (Assuming from typical workflow):

- Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values or erroneous data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and other statistical summaries to understand the dataset better.
- Feature Engineering: If applicable, transforming or creating new features that might improve the model’s performance.

## Model Preparation:

- Feature Selection: Choosing the appropriate features for training the KNN model.
- Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## KNN Model Training:

- Model Training: Applying the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm, likely using a library such as scikit-learn.
- Parameter Tuning: Adjusting parameters like the number of neighbors (k-value) to optimize model accuracy.

## Model Evaluation:

- Testing the Model: Using the test set to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the KNN model.
- Result Visualization: Graphical representation of model performance, possibly including confusion matrices or ROC curves.

## Conclusion:

- Summary of Findings: Key insights from using KNN on the anonymized dataset.
- Implications: Discussion of the model's applicability and potential areas for improvement.
