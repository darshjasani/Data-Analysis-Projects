## Data Visualization with Diamond Dataset
This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks designed for practicing and exploring different data visualization techniques using the Diamond dataset and other supplementary datasets. Each notebook focuses on specific types of plots, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multivariate visualizations to gain insights into the data.

## Contents
# Notebooks

1) Adapted_Plot_Practice.ipynb

This notebook explores adapted visualizations to enhance data interpretation. Custom plots and adjustments to existing plots (e.g., adjusting color, size, or axes) are demonstrated for deeper insights.

2) Additional_Plot_Practice.ipynb

Here, you will find additional plot types not commonly covered in basic visualizations, including specialized visualizations like heatmaps, pair plots, and advanced seaborn/matplotlib techniques.

3) Bar_Chart_Practice.ipynb

This notebook focuses on creating effective bar charts. It includes examples of both categorical and numerical bar charts, showcasing different styles (stacked, grouped) for comparing values across categories.

4) Bivariate_Exploration_Diamond_Data.ipynb

In this notebook, bivariate analysis is performed on the Diamond dataset. It includes scatterplots and correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables such as price, carat, and clarity.

5) Categorical_vs_Categorical_Clustered_Bar_Charts_Practice.ipynb

This notebook specifically focuses on comparing two categorical variables using clustered bar charts. It explores various ways to represent categorical data side-by-side for better comparison.

6) Encodings_faceting_multivariates.ipynb

Learn how to use encoding techniques and facet grids to display multivariate data effectively. This notebook covers advanced data visualization strategies using seaborn's facet grid functionality.

7) Explanatory_Polishing_Diamond_Data.ipynb

This notebook takes the Diamond dataset and focuses on producing polished, explanatory visualizations. It's designed to communicate insights clearly, including annotations and well-defined color schemes.

8) Histogram_Practice.ipynb

Focuses on creating histograms to explore the distribution of numerical variables. Multiple techniques for tweaking histograms (bin sizes, overlays) are also explored.

9) Multivariate_Exploration_Diamond_Data.ipynb

Explores relationships between multiple variables in the Diamond dataset using advanced visualizations like pair plots, heatmaps, and violin plots to understand how different variables interact.


10) Numerical_vs_Categorical_Violin_and_Box_Plot_Practice.ipynb

This notebook explores how numerical and categorical data can be visualized together using violin plots and box plots. These plots help to understand the distribution and variance of numerical data within categories.

11) Numerical_vs_Numerical_Scatterplot_Practice.ipynb

Focuses on using scatterplots to compare two numerical variables. Examples include scatterplots with trend lines, regression lines, and color encoding for additional dimensions.

12) Scales_and_Transformations_Practice.ipynb

This notebook explores the use of different scales and transformations to improve data visualization, including logarithmic scales and normalizing data to enhance readability.

13) Univariate_Exploration_Diamond_Data.ipynb

Focuses on univariate exploration of the Diamond dataset, such as analyzing the distribution of individual variables using histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.

# Datasets

1) diamonds.csv

The primary dataset used for most visualizations in this repository. It contains information on the prices and characteristics of diamonds, such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more.

2) fuel_econ.csv

An additional dataset containing information about fuel economy, used for practicing data visualization techniques outside the context of the Diamond dataset.

3) pokemon.csv

A supplementary dataset used in some notebooks for practicing categorical visualizations and exploratory data analysis on Pok√©mon statistics.

## Purpose of the Repository

The primary objective of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of examples for data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The Diamond dataset serves as a rich dataset to practice visualizing categorical and numerical data, understand trends, and communicate findings effectively through visuals.
