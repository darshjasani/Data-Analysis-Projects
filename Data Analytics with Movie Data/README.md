## Investigate Movies Dataset
This project analyzes a movie dataset to uncover trends and relationships between movie attributes such as budget, revenue, popularity, and genre over time. The primary goal is to provide insights into what makes a movie successful, with particular emphasis on budget, revenue, and popularity metrics.

## Key Features

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, erroneous zeros, and outliers in budget and revenue data.

Analysis of Popularity: Explored how budget affects popularity and which genres are most popular.

Budget and Revenue Trends: Investigated the trend of increasing budgets and revenues over time.

Optimal Movie Length: Analyzed the runtime associated with the most successful movies.

Genre and Year Correlation: Examined the relationship between different genres and their performance over the years.

## Conclusion

High-budget movies generally produce higher average popularity, though high budget doesnâ€™t guarantee success.

The ideal runtime for popular movies is around 150 minutes, with Drama, Comedy, and Action being the top-performing genres.

Over time, the movie industry has expanded, offering a wider range of genres and more high-budget films.

## Limitations
Missing data and erroneous zeros may affect the accuracy of the analysis.
Currency for foreign films and inflation are not accounted for.
Methods of measuring vote counts and popularity are unclear.
