# Predicting Credit Card Approvals Using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the steps involved in building a machine learning model to predict credit card approvals based on various applicant attributes. The model is trained using logistic regression, and several preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the data.

## Approach and Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
### Handling Missing Values
The dataset contains missing values represented by the character '?'. These missing values are replaced with NaN to prepare the data for further processing. We then impute the missing values using mean imputation. This method fills the missing entries with the mean value of the respective feature, ensuring that the dataset remains intact and no data is lost during preprocessing.

- Why Mean Imputation?: Some machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, cannot handle missing data. Mean imputation is a straightforward and efficient way to fill in missing values without introducing significant bias.

### Encoding Categorical Features
The dataset contains several categorical features, such as marital status, job type, and education. These features are converted into numeric values using label encoding. Each category is assigned a unique integer, making the dataset compatible with logistic regression.

- Why Label Encoding?: Logistic regression models and other machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs. Label encoding transforms non-numeric categorical data into a format the model can process.

### Scaling the Features
All numerical features are scaled using a MinMaxScaler, which transforms values into the range [0, 1]. This scaling ensures that all features are on a similar scale, which helps improve the performance of the logistic regression model.

- Why Scaling?: Logistic regression relies on gradient descent for optimization, and scaling the features ensures that the algorithm converges more quickly and effectively by reducing the impact of large feature values.

2. Building the Logistic Regression Model

### Model Selection: Logistic Regression
The model used for prediction is logistic regression, which is a well-suited algorithm for binary classification tasks like credit card approval (approved or denied). Logistic regression provides an interpretable model by associating a weight (or coefficient) with each feature, allowing us to understand which factors are most important in the approval decision.

- Why Logistic Regression?: It is a powerful yet interpretable algorithm for binary classification. It also performs well with a wide range of datasets and is computationally efficient.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning

To optimize the logistic regression model, we use a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation. This process systematically tests different values for hyperparameters (e.g., max_iter, tol) to find the best combination that maximizes the model's accuracy.

- Why Grid Search with Cross-Validation?: Grid search helps identify the optimal hyperparameters by evaluating the model's performance on different subsets of the data. Cross-validation ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.

4. Model Evaluation

The performance of the logistic regression model is evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting credit card approvals. The best score achieved, along with the optimal hyperparameters, is recorded.

## Conclusion
This project walks through the essential steps for predicting credit card approvals using logistic regression. It highlights important preprocessing techniques like handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features, followed by the implementation of a logistic regression model and hyperparameter tuning using grid search.
