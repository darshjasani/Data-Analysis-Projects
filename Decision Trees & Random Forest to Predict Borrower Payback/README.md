# Predicting Borrower Payback with Lending Club Dataset
This Jupyter notebook focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether borrowers from the Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform, will pay back their loans. The model aims to help investors make informed decisions about whom to lend money. This analysis forms a part of the coursework for "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" available on Udemy.

## Dataset
The dataset covers loan data from 2007 to 2010 provided by the Lending Club. It includes detailed information on the borrowers' financial background, loan details, and payback status.

## Notebook Contents
1) Introduction:

Detailed project explanation.
Background on Lending Club and the significance of the project for potential investors.

2) Importing Libraries:

- pandas for data manipulation.
- numpy for numerical operations.
- seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization.
- scipy.stats for statistical analysis.

3) Data Retrieval:

Loading the dataset using pandas.read_csv() from a CSV file named loan_data.csv.

4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Initial exploration to understand the structure and content of the data.
Visualizations to identify patterns and relationships among variables.

5) Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning data, dealing with missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Normalization or scaling of data as required.

6) Model Building:

Construction of Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
Explanation of the choice of models and their parameters.

7) Model Evaluation:

Discussing the performance metrics used to evaluate the model.
Visual representations of results and a summary of the model's effectiveness.
